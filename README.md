## Problem Statement
The project addresses the following:
- Predict the number of food hampers needed.
- Identify specific geographical areas where demand is high.
- Understand the relationship between demand and factors such as holidays.

## Workflow
1. **Data Cleaning**: Removed inconsistencies and handled missing data.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Created meaningful features to improve model accuracy.
3. **Model Selection**: Evaluated multiple models, with Linear Regression emerging as the optimal choice.
4. **Evaluation**: Assessed model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE).

## Notebooks
- `food_hamper_model_love3.ipynb`: Focuses on model selection and final evaluation.
- `food_hamper_8_final.ipynb`: Covers the complete workflow, from data cleaning to model deployment.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Libraries listed in `requirements.txt`

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
